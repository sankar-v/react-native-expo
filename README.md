Of the 2 ways to create a react application, Expo and create-react-native, when one takes the path of create-react-native approach, the expo path is almost always forgotten. Expo offers a controlled mobile application develoopment. Controlled in the sense that olne is limited to using what is offered by the platform and with some limitations. If one needsto harness the full potential of a mobile app, then create-react-native is one step ahead. But still ahead is the native development platform tools which give unhindered performant application. 

Having got used to create-reatc-native approach, we hardly got to know the expo offering. This exercise was an attempt to use expo for developing a mobile app using react .. understand its limitations and strengths and eventually upgrade the app to uncontrolled an to a more integrated mobile application development. 

There is plenty of documentation.. but felt the documentation in expo is precise and logically flowing to understand expo. Here is the url https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/ to expo which is the basis of this exercise.  Following those instructions one could check out this source and run without issues.

Note:

This exercise was warranted when migration of an existing project using the older version (<v3+ of react navigation, < v16+ of react and their dependencies, etc) to latest versions and the reolution of error and dependencies severely stress our thinking. Eventually we left that as an exercise to some other time and switched over to a brand new project with expo an dthe latest versions which was faster.  So the expereince is it is time vs. speed. If one has time, one could resolve all the issues slowly and learn a lot through the process but if the idea is to quickly set up one, and not waste time, then speed is vital..and dont end up spending time on resolvinh unnecessary dependencies unless really needed.  

Happy programming!!
