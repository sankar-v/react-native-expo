"# react-native-expo" 
Of the 2 ways to create a react application, Expo and create-react-native, when one takes the path of create-react-native approach, the expo path is almost always forgotten. Expo offers a controlled mobile application develoopment. Controlled in the sense that olne is limited to using what is offered by the platform and with some limitations. If one needsto harness the full potential of a mobile app, then create-react-native is one step ahead. But still ahead is the native development platform tools which give unhindered performant application. 

Having got used to create-reatc-native approach, we hardly got to know the expo offering. This exercise was an attempt to use expo for developing a mobile app using react .. understand its limitations and strengths and eventually upgrade the app to uncontrolled an to a more integrated mobile application development. 

There is plenty of documentation.. but felt the documentation in expo is precise and logically flowing to understand expo. Here is the url https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/ to expo which is the basis of this exercise.  Following those instructions one could check out this source and run without issues.

Happy programming!!
